# Note Taker Application

## Description

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with making modifications to a note-taking application designed for small business owners. More specifically, I was tasked with creating fully-functioning server routes for HTTP GET, POST, and DELETE requests to the server. During this exercise, I learned how to to send data to and read data from the back end with the help of express.js. End-users are now able to create and save notes in the application and can also delete notes with the help of these server routes.

## Usage

Below you will find screenshots of the deployed web application, the first of which is the home page for this application, and the second of which is the page on which notes are taken, stored, and deleted:

As you can see from the second screenshot, end-users can access notes they have previously made in the left-hand pane. As soon as a note is clicked, the note's title and content are displayed in the maing right-hand pane for viewing.


## Credits

I would like to credit the contributor Xandromus for desiging the front-end of this web application and for providing me with the server.js file in which the server routes were created.

## Features

- Fully-functional server routes for GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP requests as well as HTML routes for the home page and the notes page
- Note taking system in which notes can be taken, stored, and deleted when no longer needed
- Clean and polished user interface
